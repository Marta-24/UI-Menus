## UI MENUS
Most of the RPGs can be considered “menu games”, due to the amount of time spent in those screens, managing the group, shopping, assigning abilities or fighting.
It's come to a point where players don’t even realize it's part of the basic genre.

For example, the player gets a character, they want to choose an ability, just that action gives the player a few options, and sometimes there are sub abilities. Depending on the game, the player has to choose whether they want to defend or attack. After that, they have to choose which enemy to attack.
It's a few selections, but a lot of variables in only 1 character.

Without noticing, the players spend a lot of time in menus. Without realizing it, players’ first impressions about the game can depend a lot on how visually pleasant the menus are.

#Main Menu
Is the first thing a player sees when opening a game. Because of how often we see them, main menus have the tendency to get burned into our brains without us realizing it. The text and sound become too familiar.
